# YapScript
A programming language designed to compile with brainrot keywords!

# How to use

`python yap_script_compiler.py [yapscript file]`

# Usage
* Variables

You can create variables with the keyword `lowkey`, it may sound weird but this programming language is designed to resemble English.

<b>Example</b>

```
lowkey a isfinnabe 10
```
intepreted as javascript:
```js
let a = 10
```

* libraries

You can use libraries using the `airdrop` keyword then the library name.

<b>Example</b>
```py
airdrop math

# Every math function is imported to code.
# The math functions are [random]
# you can call the function with [library_name][function_name] [arguments separated by spaces]
```

```py
airdrop math
lowkey random isfinnabe ?mathrandom,0,10
```

If you use variable declaration and want the return value,

* You can do: 

```
# lowkey [name] isfinnabe ?[func_name],[arg1],[arg2]....
```

* Function Calls

If you want to call a function do

```bash
[function_name] args....
[function_name] $[variable_name]
```
